    </header>
    Hi, my name is Chris Kinsch. I like learning new things, which has led me to
    learning how to code.
    I attended Penn State University Abington Campus and graduated with a Bachelor's
    degree in Psychological and Social Sciences. This psych degree led me to getting
    my first job after graduation at a psychological hospital. I learned alot about
    people and their behavior there, but most importantly I learned alot about myself.
    The most important thing I learnedabout myself being that I was not cut out for a
    job in the psych field. This led me on a long and winding path to try to find out
    where I belonged and what I would be most happy doing. This path has led me here
    to learning the ins and outs of how to write code to make peoples lives simpler
    and more enjoyable.
